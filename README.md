# Handwritten Character Recognition System

This repository contains the implementation of a **Handwritten Character Recognition System** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to recognize English alphabets (A-Z) from handwritten input and convert them into machine-readable and editable digital text. This system can be used for various applications like digitization of documents, educational tools, and accessibility features.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately recognize handwritten characters using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs. The system processes an image of a handwritten character, predicts the corresponding alphabet, and outputs the result. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning in the real-world problem of handwriting recognition.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of 26 classes, each representing one alphabet (A-Z). Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a single handwritten character. The dataset is stored in a CSV format where each row represents one image, with the label (0-25) representing the characters (A-Z).

### Dataset Information:
- **Input Image Size**: 28x28 pixels
- **Number of Classes**: 26 (A-Z)
- **Number of Images**: 372,450

## Model Architecture
The model is built using **Keras** and consists of multiple **Convolutional Layers** followed by **MaxPooling Layers** to extract features, a **Flattening Layer** to convert the matrix into a vector, and fully connected **Dense Layers** for classification.

### CNN Architecture:
1. **Conv2D Layer**: 32 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), activation function: ReLU.
2. **MaxPooling Layer**: Pool size of (2, 2), strides of 2.
3. **Conv2D Layer**: 64 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), activation function: ReLU.
4. **MaxPooling Layer**: Pool size of (2, 2), strides of 2.
5. **Conv2D Layer**: 128 filters, kernel size of (3, 3), activation function: ReLU.
6. **MaxPooling Layer**: Pool size of (2, 2), strides of 2.
7. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the matrix into a vector.
8. **Dense Layer**: 64 units, activation function: ReLU.
9. **Dense Layer**: 128 units, activation function: ReLU.
10. **Output Layer**: 26 units, activation function: Softmax for classification.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-recognition
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the dataset** (link or add instructions to download the dataset if it's not included in the repository).

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook or Python script** for training the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   # or
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model on the provided dataset.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict characters from handwritten input.
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

3. **External Image Prediction**: Run the script to predict characters from an external image.
   ```bash
   python external_image_prediction.py
   ```

## Results
The model was trained for one epoch with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and achieved the following accuracies:
- **Training Accuracy**: `XX%`
- **Validation Accuracy**: `XX%`

Visual examples of predicted characters on test data and an external image are provided in the notebook/script.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for recognizing words and sentences instead of individual characters.
- Improve accuracy with data augmentation and a larger training dataset.
- Implement handwriting recognition for different languages and symbols.
